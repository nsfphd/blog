    "text": "In my day job, I’m a clinical informaticist for the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, specializing in secondary data use, or the taking of data collected for clinical use and turning it into something that can be used in research. My personal research is on the debates at the turn of the 20th century between professional and lay audiences in public health production, and particularly how physicians, consumers, and farmers came together over the question of clean milk production.\nI’m keenly interested in how different social groups interact through their artifacts, be the artifacts in question data, processes, or actual physical objects. Which is an elaborate way of saying that while my personal research and professional work don’t look related at first, they really are.\n\nEducation\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute | Troy, NY PhD in Science and Technology Studies\nDissertation: “Contingent Mechanization: The Case of American Dairying”\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute | Troy, NY MS in Information Technology\nMount Holyoke College | South Hadley, MD\nBA in Music"

    "text": "The Feliciano is silent\nI come by my interest in how different groups interact over a specific object via a few routes, but let’s start with my name. It’s Foster, or it’s Foster Feliciano, but never Feliciano. This is because it’s a Latin American name, and in Latin America last names are composed of two elements: the primer apellido or what English speakers call the last name, and the segundo apellido which most would call the mother’s maiden name. It’s standard to use both for all but the most informal interactions. It’s so standard that when my dad set up his bank account in Puerto Rico, the bank went into his social security record to pull out the segundo apellido he must have OBVIOUSLY forgotten to fill in on the account forms."
