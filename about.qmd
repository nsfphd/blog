In my day job, I'm a clinical informaticist for the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, specializing in secondary data use, or the taking of data collected for clinical use and turning it into something that can be used in research. My personal research is on the debates at the turn of the 20th century between professional and lay audiences in public health production, and particularly how physicians, consumers, and farmers came together over the question of clean milk production.

I'm keenly interested in how different social groups interact through their artifacts, be the artifacts in question data, processes, or actual physical objects. Which is an elaborate way of saying that while my personal research and professional work don't look related at first, they really are.
