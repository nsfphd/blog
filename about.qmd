By day, I'm a clinical informaticist for the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University, specializing in secondary data use, or the taking of data collected for clinical use and turning it into something that can be used in research. My personal research is on the social dimensions of US medicine from 1890-ish to WWI, particularly as it relates to pediatrics and the emergence of germ theory, vaccination, and the overall change in understanding of public health across various social groups.

I'm keenly interested in how different social groups interact through their artifacts, be the artifacts in question data, processes, or actual physical objects. Which is an elaborate way of saying that while my personal research and professional work don't look related at first, they really are.
